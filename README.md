Python is a wonderful language but it can be daunting for a newcomer to master. Like any spoken language, Python requires us to
first understand the basics before we can jump to building more diverse and broader applications in the data science field.
Python is of course an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language. This is a wide concept and is not quite possible to grasp all at once.
In fact, mastering OOP can take several months or even years. It totally depends upon your understanding capability.
I highly recommend going through my previous article on the ‘Basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming‘ first.
